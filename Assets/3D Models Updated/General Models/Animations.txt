--- Notes ---
The game is a First Person VR game, so weird artifacts and animation issues, which
cannot be seen from the first person perspective, are okay.

The first 2 animations require individual animation of 2 objects;
Player model and backpack. The animations should be exported for each object.

The last animation is on a new model, the players arm which has been cut off

The only type of animation which is supported is Bone / Joint animation and only
animations which can be baked onto the bones. This means that: Derformers, Muscles. etc
are not supported. 
IK is partially supported, it works when the IK animation is baked onto the bones, but the
IK rig and IK Handle animations cannot be exported to Unity.

The backpack currently has a open / close animation, delete these as you see fit.

Export the animations as FBX with the model.
Only enable: Smoothing groups, Include Geometry, Include Animation
